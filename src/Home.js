      <p className="about">I’m Anna! 👋🏼 I’m a Software Developer, user experience advocate and totally cool Mom based in Arizona.
Professionally, I’ve spent most of my career at the service of others. I am incredibly passionate about both client and employee experiences. As a result, I approach my work through the lens of the end user and strategize how I can create the best possible experience for them. My passion for creative problem solving, building genuine relationships and maintaining a ‘people first’ mindset resulted in a lot of success in my field. That said, despite my professional successes, I couldn’t help but feel a bit uninspired by my work at times over the past few years. I wasn’t sure that I wanted to spend the rest of my career executing corporate retail strategy and felt like if I was going to pivot, I needed to do so soon.
Cue a global pandemic that changed the retail landscape massively. The pandemic combined with internal shifts and changes within my organization resulted in the realization that I needed a change and so I turned in my resignation. In the same week, I signed up for a ‘Try Coding’ workshop and was instantly hooked. I applied to the Front End program that same day that I did the workshop. Six months later, I’m just about finished with the program and I’ve loved every single second of it. I feel as though I found the missing piece in my life. Software Development has given me the space and the skills to do what I feel I do best, solve everyday problems and improve the lives of everyday people.</p>
